New feelings around the way my long term partner interacts with me?

My husband, Darren, and I have two children and have been married 10 years, poly that whole time. I've always felt so in love with him and felt like he was amazing and I wasn't good enough for him. He takes care of me, is a good provider, deals with all of my flaws and is a person I admire greatly. I've enjoyed other relationships and never had any problems and they all ended amicably.

But I started dating another man, John, about a year ago and while our relationship isn't perfect, I'm really enjoying it and feel really strongly towards John.

John and I will never be each other's primary partner for various reasons but the interactions I have with him make me look at some things Darren does in another light. Some examples: Darren is not interested in me sharing my thoughts, feelings, day to day things. He tolerates them but doesn't ask follow up questions or show independent interest in them or me. Darren is sometimes loud and intimidating and uses his size to make me back off when we disagree. Darren says he'll do things like mow the lawn, do things for the children or plan a date but rarely follows through. Darren sometimes says things that I now think are inappropriate, like that I should be grateful to be with him because no one else would put up with me or that no one else treats their wives as well as he treats me, things like that. 

Has anyone else dealt with these feelings or realizations about important relationships? How can I improve my mindset around my relationship with Darren? I want to go back to being content with my marriage.
